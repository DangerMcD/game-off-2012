## Clone Source

This short prototype game involves controlling one or more "Users" to accomplish a "Task" by cloning themselves and pushing or pulling boxes.
The player uses these abilities to move each Task into the Completion Zone. Once all Tasks are completed, a Door will open and the player can progress.

## Basic Controls

The player can select either a User or a Task and apply different controls:

* W = JUMP
* A = MOVE LEFT
* D = MOVE RIGHT
* S = STOP MOVING
* Q = COMBINE
* E = CLONE
* SPACE = ACTION/COMPLETE TASK/ASSIGN TASK/UN-ASSIGN TASK
